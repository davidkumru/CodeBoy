# CodeBoy
2D platformer engine in JavaScript

## Features
- Separate vertical and horizontal collision detection applied to all level objects (static and animated). This results in  automated resolution of character attacks (vertical top-down collision) and character damage (horizontal and vertical bottom-up collision). Defining a neutral or hostile object is a matter of modifying an if-statement.
